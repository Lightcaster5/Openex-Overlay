# Openex Overlay
a simple overlay for Hypixel Bedwars

## Features
- Simple design
- Speed
- Stats index system

## Usage
Just run the file according to your computer in [releases](https://github.com/Lightcaster5/Openex-Overlay/releases) and an icon should pop up on your desktop. Either do `/api new` or manually set the key in settings.

Alternatively, if you wish to compile it, **(NOT recommended)**, you can clone the repository, run `npm install`, then use either [electron-packager](https://electron.github.io/electron-packager/main/), or [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/). Any other compilers *should* work, but we have not tested them.
