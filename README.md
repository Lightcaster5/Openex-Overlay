# Openex Overlay
Hypixel Bedwars stats overlay

## Features
- Simple & easy-to-use design
- Ultra fast async loading
- Player stat indexing
- Customizable log directory
- Index difficulty calculation

## Usage
Download the overlay from [releases](https://github.com/Lightcaster5/Openex-Overlay/releases), an icon should be created on your desktop. To begin grabbing stats, select your log path and enter your API key in settings. *(Use `/api new` in game or manually set in settings)*

#### NOT RECOMMENDED
Alternatively, if you wish to compile it, you can clone the repository, run `npm install`, then use either [electron-packager](https://electron.github.io/electron-packager/main/), or [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/). Any other compilers *should* work, but we have not tested them.
