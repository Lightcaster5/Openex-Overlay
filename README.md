# Openex Overlay
Hypixel Bedwars stats overlay

## Features
- Simple & easy-to-use design
- Ultra fast async loading
- Player stat indexing
- Index difficulty calculation
- HypixelAPI failsafe (added after [hypixel 504 errors](https://hypixel.net/threads/hypixel-api-returning-504-gateway-timeout-error.4649225/))
- API key storage *(stored in `{User}/AppData/Roaming/openex/openex-properties.json`)*

## Usage
1. Download the overlay from [releases](https://github.com/Lightcaster5/Openex-Overlay/releases), an icon should be created on your desktop.
2. Launch [Lunar Client](https://lunarclient.com/download) **BEFORE RUNNING OPENEX**
3. Join Hypixel and run `/api new` *(or manually set in `openex-properties.json`)*
4. Join a game of BedWars, if needed, use `/who` to refresh everyone in your game.

#### NOT RECOMMENDED
Alternatively, if you wish to compile it, you can clone the repository, run `npm install`, then use either [electron-packager](https://electron.github.io/electron-packager/main/), or [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/). Any other compilers *should* work, but we have not tested them.
